            <p>These Tester Terms &amp; Conditions (the “Terms”) set forth the terms under which you may participate in user experience studies for Apptourage, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices at 550 Bryant Street, San Francisco, CA, 94107, USA (“Apptourage”). By indicating your acceptance in the “I Agree” field, you agree to abide by and to be bound by these Terms. You also represent and warrant that you are 18 years of age or older. If you do not agree to these Terms or if you are under 18 years of age, do not fill in the “I Agree” field, and you will not be able to act as a Tester (as defined below) for Apptourage.</p>
            <h3>1.0 Overview</h3>
            <h5>1.1 Site and User Testing</h5>
            <p>Apptourage has developed a software platform (“Site”) that enables a real person (“Customer”) to request a Test (as defined below) to be performed by another real person (“Tester”). Testers are neither employees nor agents of Apptourage, but are independent service providers using the Site to provide their services (“User Testing Services”) to Customers. The Site matches Testers to Customers who want a mobile application, website, advertisement, logo, picture, animation, video, or other digital element (the “Elements”) remotely and manually analyzed via the Internet by Testers (the “Tests”). You agree to the Tester obligations as fully set forth in the complete sections referenced below, each of which is a condition precedent to your participation as a Tester.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You will provide accurate account information (see Tester Account Information)</li>
              <li>You will maintain certain equipment and accounts (see Tester Requirements)</li>
              <li>You will maintain the confidence of all information you received during the course of your activities as a Tester (see Confidentiality and Security and Passwords)</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>1.2 Independent Contractor Status</h5>
            <p>You are acting as an independent contractor as a Tester for Apptourage. Nothing in these Terms will be construed to make you an agent, employee or legal representative of Apptourage. You will not be entitled to any benefits and you are solely responsible for your taxes.</p>
            <h5>1.3 Third-Party Beneficiary</h5>
            <p>Apptourage’s Customers for which you complete Tests shall be considered third party beneficiaries of these Terms to the extent that any act or omission by you causes any damage or liability to any such Customer, and such Customer shall have the right to enforce any provision of these Terms.</p>
            <h3>2.0 Tester Obligations</h3>
            <h5>2.1 Tester Account and Information</h5>
            <p>You agree that you will create no more than one account to complete Tests on the Site (“Tester Account”). When you register with Apptourage to become a Tester and as you perform specific Tests, you may be asked to provide information about yourself such as your name, contact information, PayPal account information, age, gender, and any other information that we may request (“Tester Information”). You represent that the Tester Information you provide to Apptourage is accurate and complete. You agree to promptly provide Apptourage with any applicable updates to the Tester Information. You agree that you will not allow anyone else to use your account and that you are liable for any actions through the use of your account. The Tester Information that you provide may be considered to be “Personally Identifiable Information” in accordance with federal and state law, and Apptourage’s privacy policy. You hereby give Apptourage permission to share your Tester Information and any Personally Identifiable Information with the Customers for whom you are a candidate for, or perform, Tests solely for the purpose of the Customers using and benefiting from the Tests. PLEASE SEE BELOW FOR MORE DETAILS REGARDING THE SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION.</p>
            <h5>2.2 Tester Requirements</h5>
            <p>You are responsible for having access to all of the following equipment needed to complete a Test:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A personal, non-commercial PC, tablet or smartphone;</li>
              <li>A valid email address;</li>
              <li>A valid PayPal account for payment processing.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>2.3 Tester Fees</h5>
            <p>You will be eligible to receive the fees displayed on the Site for completion of specific Tests (“Tester Fees”) if, and only if, you complete each Test manually from a personal PC, tablet or mobile device. If you are found to have completed tests in any other manner, including code that automatically completes Tests on the Site, you will be ineligible for Tester Fees and your account may be suspended or revoked at the sole discretion of Apptourage and its agents and assigns.</p>
            <h5>2.4 Tester Referrals</h5>
            <p>You will be eligible to receive bonus Tester Fees for referrals if, and only if, you refer other real people to create an Apptourage account and complete Tests through the Site. If you are found to have created a referral on the Site to an email address under your control, or the control of another Tester that has already created an account on Apptourage, you will be ineligible for Tester Fees of any kind and your account may be suspended or revoked at the sole discretion of Apptourage and its agents and assigns.</p>
            <h5>2.5 Computer Access</h5>
            <p>You hereby give Apptourage permission to access the PC, tablet or mobile device from which you complete specific Tests to gather information about your participation as a Tester in such Tests, including recording your computer screen actions, screenshots, clicks, and navigational data as you perform tasks on selected Elements.</p>
            <h5>2.6 Confidentiality</h5>
            <p>The information that may be provided to you as part of a Test is extremely confidential. You must understand that by agreeing to these Terms, you agree to keep in absolute confidence and not to disclose or discuss with anyone, even family members:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>any information about the Tests that you complete;</li>
              <li>any information regarding any Elements which you are testing, have tested, or will test; and</li>
              <li>any information about any Apptourage Customer.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>2.7 Purchase or Sale of Customer Securities</h5>
            <p>You agree to expressly disclaim Apptourage from any liability associated with your purchase or sale of stock in any of the Apptourage Customers for whom you perform User Testing. You may be privy to information that would make it illegal for you to purchase or sell stock in such Customers since you may have material, non-public information.</p>
            <h5>2.8 Access to Testing and Other Information</h5>
            <p>Unless Apptourage agrees in writing, then you:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>May not copy or record any of the results of your Tests;</li>
              <li>May not copy or take screenshots/videos of the Elements, and/or disclose this information to other Testers or third parties, either in person, via the Internet, or any other form of communication.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>2.9 Security and Passwords</h5>
            <p>Although Apptourage will use reasonable efforts to protect your Tester Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted over third party networks. Any transmission is at your own risk. All Tester Information you provide to Apptourage is stored on secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any usernames or passwords associated with the Apptourage account that you use to complete Tests, and for monitoring all activity under your account. You may not disclose or share your username or password with any third parties or use them for any unauthorized purpose. You shall be deemed responsible and you agree to assume full responsibility for all activities, acts or omissions of anyone that occur under your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or your account you agree to notify Apptourage immediately at the email address provided at the end of these Terms.</p>
