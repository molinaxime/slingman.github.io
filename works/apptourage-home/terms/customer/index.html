            <p>These Customer Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) form a legal contract between you and Apptourage, Inc. (“Apptourage”) that governs your access and use of Apptourage’s software and Services. By using any of the Services or the Site, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Site or Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and representing to Apptourage that you have the authority to bind the organization to these Terms (in which event, “you” will refer to the organization). You may use the Site and Services only in compliance with these Terms and only if you have the power to form a contract with Apptourage and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, YOU MUST NOT USE THE SITE OR SERVICES.</p>
            <h3>1.0 Overview &amp; Orders</h3>
            <h5>1.1 Tests and Testing Contractors</h5>
            <p>Apptourage has developed a software platform (“Site”) that enables customers to run usability tests (“User Tests”) and allows testers selected in accordance with customer direction (“Testing Contractors”) to perform User Tests for the customers. The Testing Contractors are neither employees nor agents of Apptourage, but are independent service providers using the Site to provide services to you by participating in User Tests. Apptourage disclaims liability for the acts or omissions by anyone who is not an employee of Apptourage.</p>
            <h5>1.2 Orders</h5>
            <p>Apptourage shall provide you a limited right to access and use the Site for the purposes of initiating and reviewing User Tests. In addition, Apptourage may perform professional services related to such User Tests (“Services”) in material compliance with your online orders (“Order(s)”). Orders shall include any signed statements of work. Collectively, results of User Tests and Services deliverables shall be referred to as “Deliverables”. By completing an Order, you may initiate and review up to the number of User Tests that you designate in your Order within the period specified in the Order (the “Order Term”). Unless otherwise specified, the Order Term for all Orders initiated through the Site is one (1) year. Upon completion of each User Test you initiate and review, Apptourage will provide the Deliverables specified in your Order for that User Test. All Orders shall be deemed incorporated into these Terms and governed by the terms herein.</p>
            <h5>1.3 User Test Data Storage</h5>
            <p>Apptourage will store, and make available in each customer account, data collected from User Tests for a period of one (1) year from the Order completion date, after which, User Test data may be removed from the respective customer account.</p>
            <h3>2.0 Pricing &amp; Payment Terms</h3>
            <h5>2.1 Pricing and Payment Terms</h5>
            <p>The rates and reimbursable expenses for access and use of the Site and the provision of the Services shall be as set forth in an Order. Additional charges will apply in the event that customer’s usage of the Site or Services exceeds the baseline parameters set forth in the applicable Order. When Apptourage invoices a customer for fees pursuant to an Order, customer shall pay to Apptourage the full, undisputed amount of each Order within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the invoice (“Payment Period”). In the event that customer disputes an invoice, customer must notify Apptourage within the Payment Period or the invoice shall be deemed undisputed. Overdue undisputed invoices that remain unpaid fifteen (15) days after receipt shall be grounds for Apptourage to terminate customer’s access to the Site or Services without refund of any fees paid. Apptourage will not provide any refunds if customer does not initiate all of customer’s designated User Tests before the end of the applicable Order Term. To initiate additional User Tests, customer must complete a new Order.</p>
            <h5>2.2 Taxes</h5>
            <p>Amounts payable to Apptourage under this Agreement are payable in full to Apptourage without deduction and are net of taxes (including any sales, use, excise, ad valorem, property, withholding, value added tax, or other tax and any income tax withheld at source), tariff, duty or assessment levied or imposed by any government authority (including without limitation any country, state, city, county, province, department, or other subdivision of government) that may be applicable to the purchase of Software licenses or Services hereunder. Customer shall pay and shall indemnify and hold Apptourage harmless from all such taxes and customs duties.  </p>
            <h3>3.0 Intellectual Property</h3>
            <h5>3.1 Apptourage Property</h5>
            <p>“Apptourage Property” means any pre-existing intellectual property rights of Apptourage that are utilized by Apptourage in performance of its obligations under these Terms such as computer software, reports or methodologies. Apptourage Property also includes any elements of Services, subject to your rights in your Confidential Information that are of general applicability to Apptourage’s business and provisions of services to other clients. Apptourage Property will be the sole property of Apptourage and, even if incorporated into a Deliverable, will not be deemed to be a Deliverable. Apptourage Property shall be deemed to be Apptourage’s Confidential Information. Apptourage hereby grants you an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive license to use the Apptourage Property solely as incorporated in the Deliverables for your internal business purposes.</p>
            <h5>3.2 Customer Property</h5>
            <p>No Confidential Information obtained by Apptourage from you shall become Apptourage’s property. All materials provided by you under any Orders shall be deemed “Customer Property” for purposes of the Agreement. During the performance of Apptourage’s obligations under these Terms, and subject to Apptourage’s compliance with the terms of these Terms, you grant to Apptourage a temporary, non-exclusive license to your Customer Property solely as needed to perform Apptourage’s obligations in connection with these Terms; For avoidance of confusion, this license granted by you to Apptourage for this purpose will expire upon the earlier of: (i) the time at which such license is no longer required by Apptourage for the performance of its obligations to you, or (ii) termination of these Terms or the applicable Order. You also grant to Apptourage an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive license to use the results made available to you by Apptourage as part of your User Tests for the purpose of promoting the Apptourage site and for the provision of services to other Apptourage customers; provided that, Apptourage shall completely remove all identifying references to you before such use. No other licenses, express or implied, under any intellectual property rights are granted by you to Apptourage under these Terms.</p>
            <h5>3.3 Deliverables</h5>
            <p>Apptourage agrees that to the extent that a Deliverable is subject to copyright: (a) every aspect thereof, other than Apptourage Property that may be incorporated into the Deliverable, is a “work made for hire” (as defined in the U.S. Copyright Act); (b) you shall be considered the author of the Deliverable for all purposes; and (с) you shall be the owner of all of the rights comprised in the undivided copyright (and all renewals, extensions, and reversions thereof, and all rental rights) in and to Deliverable in perpetuity and throughout the universe. To the extent that any interest in any Deliverable may not be deemed a “work made for hire” under copyright law, Apptourage hereby irrevocably assigns to you all right, title and interest in any and all rights of copyright (and all renewals, extensions, and reversions thereof) of the Deliverable other than Apptourage Property. Apptourage agrees that it will reasonably assist you in every appropriate way and at your cost with respect to your proprietary rights in the Deliverables.</p>
            <h3>4.0 Confidentiality</h3>
            <h5>4.1 Confidential Information</h5>
            <p>Each party (“Recipient”) agrees to retain in confidence any information provided to it by the other party (“Discloser”) that is marked, labeled or otherwise designated as confidential or proprietary or that Recipient knew, or should have known, was confidential due to the circumstances surrounding the disclosure by Discloser (“Confidential Information”). Confidential Information shall not include any information that (a) is publicly known at the time of disclosure, (b) is received by Recipient without restriction from a third party, (с) is published or otherwise made known to the public by Discloser, (d) was generated independently without reference to the other party’s Confidential Information, or (e) is required to be disclosed under a court order or pursuant to any governmental rule, regulation or statute, provided that Recipient provide Discloser with prior written notice of such disclosure, as permitted by law. Recipient shall use at least the same standard of care with the Discloser’s Confidential Information as it does with its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than reasonable care. Upon termination or expiration of these Terms, or upon Discloser’s request, Recipient shall return or destroy all Confidential Information provided under these Terms. Each party acknowledges that breach of this provision would result in irreparable harm to the other party, for which monetary damages would be an insufficient remedy, and therefore that the other party will be entitled to seek injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this Section.</p>
            <h5>4.2 Return of Confidential Information</h5>
            <p>Promptly after receipt of written request from the other party, each party shall either promptly return all Confidential Information, or confirm that such Confidential Information has been destroyed.</p>
            <h5>4.3 Accepted Use</h5>
            <p>Subject to the terms and conditions herein, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Apptourage may compile aggregate results from all of, or a selection of, your use of the Site, provided that Apptourage shall not disclose any information that would individually identify you. Such aggregate results shall be deemed to be Apptourage’s Confidential Information. You also hereby agree that Apptourage may 1) use User Test results made for you to help promote the Apptourage site and to provide services to other Apptourage customers; provided that, in such instance, Apptourage will completely remove all identifying references to you and 2) review your individual use of the Site in order to provide Services to you, to evaluate Apptourage’s provision of Services, and to improve Apptourage’s service offerings.</p>
            <h5>4.4 Testing Contractors Non-Disclosure Agreement</h5>
            <p>All Testing Contractors agree to terms that include confidentiality provisions. See <a href="../tester/">Tester Terms &amp; Conditions</a> that includes a provision that you are a third party beneficiary of such terms as necessary to enforce your rights. In addition, if requested by you as part of the Services, then Apptourage shall facilitate the execution of a form non-disclosure agreement of your selection by each of the Testing Contractors before they perform Services for you.</p>
            <h3>5.0 Term &amp; Termination</h3>
            <h5>5.1 General</h5>
            <p>These Terms will apply commencing on the effective date of the first Order from you and will continue unless and until either party gives the other party written notice of termination. Upon notice of termination: (a) the parties will not enter into any additional Order under these Terms; and (b) each Order entered into prior to notice of termination will continue in full force and effect until completed, unless access to the Site or Service is terminated in accordance with Section 5.2 of these Terms.</p>
            <h5>5.2 Termination of Orders</h5>
            <p>If either party defaults in the performance of any of its material obligations under any Order or these Terms, then the other party may terminate such Order by providing written notice of such termination (including, without limitation, a detailed description of the default and the action required to cure the default); provided, however, that such termination will not be effective if the defaulting party substantially cures the default within thirty (30) days after receipt of your notice of termination. Upon termination of any Order: (a) you will pay Apptourage in accordance with Section 2 for access and use of the Site and Services performed in accordance with these Terms prior to the effective date of termination or thereafter as reasonably required for Apptourage to wind up the Services under the terminated Order; and (b) Apptourage will deliver to you all completed Deliverables and work in process.</p>
            <h5>5.3 Survival</h5>

            <h5>8.4 Governing Law</h5>

            <h5>8.7 Severability</h5>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect without being impaired or invalidated in any way. The parties agree to replace any invalid provision with a valid provision that most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the invalid provision.</p>
